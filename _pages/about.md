I am a PhD student in the [Ethics and Epistemology of Machine Learning](https://ethics.epistemology.ai) in the [Cluster of Excellence -- Machine Learning for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/epistemology-and-ethics-of-ml/) at the University of Tübingen. 

## Research

I work on methods for the normative evaluation of algorithmic policies, performativity in algorithmic fairness, and problems of evidence-based policy and philosophy of (social) sciences as they arise in machine learning.

## Education

I have a BA in Philosophy & Economics from the University of Bayreuth (2019) and MScs in Philosophy of the Social Sciences from the LSE (2020) and in Psychometrics, Econometrics, and Machine Learning from the University of Tübingen (2023).
