I am a PhD student in philosophy of (social) science and machine learning, a member of the research group [Ethics and Epistemology of Machine Learning](https://ethics.epistemology.ai){:target="_blank"} in the [Cluster of Excellence 'Machine Learning for Science'](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/){:target="_blank"}, University of Tübingen, and part of the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). 

I am supervised by [Konstantin Genin](https://kgenin.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Wolfgang Spohn](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/ag-spohn/personen/prof-dr-wolfgang-spohn/){:target="_blank"}, and [Bob Williamson](https://uni-tuebingen.de/forschung/forschungsschwerpunkte/exzellenzcluster-maschinelles-lernen/forschung/forschung/cluster-arbeitsgruppen/professuren/foundations-of-machine-learning-systems/){:target="_blank"}.

From September to December 2025, I am at the University of Groningen for a research visit with [Jan-Willem Romeijn](https://romeijn.web.rug.nl/){:target="_blank"}.

## Research

Topics: *algorithmic fairness; causal inference; philosophy of social science; statistics and machine learning*

I work on methods for the evaluation of algorithmic policies, performativity in algorithmic fairness, and problems of evidence-based policy and philosophy of (social) sciences as they arise in machine learning. 

## Education

I hold an MSc in Philosophy of the Social Sciences (LSE, 2020) and in Psychometrics, Econometrics, and Machine Learning (University of Tübingen, 2023) and a BA in Philosophy & Economics (University of Bayreuth, 2019).

## Volunteering and community work

Together with the philosophy groups at the Machine Learning Cluster, I have organized the ["Philosophy of Science meets Machine Learning"](https://sites.google.com/view/philml-tuebingen/home){:target="_blank"} conferences in 2023 and 2024.

Alongside my academic work, I am a volunteer with [CorrelAid](https://correlaid.org/){:target="blank"} and have served as chair of the board from 2022 to 2024. CorrelAid empowers non-profits to use data in a critical and reflective way to achieve their goals, while enabling effective engagement for volunteers in Data4Good.
