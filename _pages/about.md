I am a PhD student in philosophy of science and machine learning, a member of the research group [Ethics and Epistemology of Machine Learning](https://ethics.epistemology.ai){:target="_blank"} in the [Cluster of Excellence 'Machine Learning for Science'](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/epistemology-and-ethics-of-ml/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Tübingen, and part of the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). 

I am supervised by [Konstantin Genin](https://kgenin.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Wolfgang Spohn](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/ag-spohn/personen/prof-dr-wolfgang-spohn/){:target="_blank"}, and [Bob Williamson](https://uni-tuebingen.de/forschung/forschungsschwerpunkte/exzellenzcluster-maschinelles-lernen/forschung/forschung/cluster-arbeitsgruppen/professuren/foundations-of-machine-learning-systems/){:target="_blank"}.

From September to December 2025, I will be in Groningen for a research visit with [Jan Willem Romeijn](https://romeijn.web.rug.nl/){:target="_blank"}.

## Research

*statistics and machine learning, algorithmic fairness, causal inference, philosophy of social science*

I work on methods for the evaluation of algorithmic policies, performativity in algorithmic fairness, and problems of evidence-based policy and philosophy of (social) sciences as they arise in machine learning.

## Education

I hold a BA in Philosophy & Economics from the University of Bayreuth, an MSc in Philosophy of the Social Sciences from the LSE, and an MSc in Psychometrics, Econometrics, and Machine Learning from the University of Tübingen.
