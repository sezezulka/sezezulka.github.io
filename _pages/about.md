I am a PhD student in the research group [Ethics and Epistemology of Machine Learning](https://ethics.epistemology.ai){:target="_blank"} in the [Cluster of Excellence 'Machine Learning for Science'](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/epistemology-and-ethics-of-ml/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Tübingen and part of the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). 

I am supervised by [Konstantin Genin](https://kgenin.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, Wolfgang Spohn, and Bob Williamson.

## Research

*statistics and machine learning, algorithmic fairness, causal inference, philosophy of social science*

I work on methods for the normative evaluation of algorithmic policies, performativity in algorithmic fairness, and problems of evidence-based policy and philosophy of (social) sciences as they arise in machine learning.

## Education

I hold a BA in Philosophy & Economics from the University of Bayreuth (2019), an MSc in Philosophy of the Social Sciences from the LSE (2020), and an MSc in Psychometrics, Econometrics, and Machine Learning from the University of Tübingen (2023).
